# Lecture 3: Introduction to Data

**Trevor Bedford ([@trvrb](https://twitter.com/trvrb), [bedford.io](https://bedford.io))**

## Learning objectives

- Apply computational project organization principles specifically to good practices in data management
- Implement best practices for organizing tabular (spreadsheet-style) data according to tidy data principles

## Class materials

1. [File organization and naming](#project-and-data-organization)
2. [Tidy data](#tidy-data)

This class requires Microsoft Excel (or an equivalent program that can open `.xlsx` files); see [Software installation](../../software/) for more information.

## Reminders

- Recommended reading is available throughout each section
- Please have R and RStudio installed with additional packages installed before the next class session. See [Software installation](../../software/) for more information.

## Project and data organization

It's important to keep a tidy project directory, even if something is not as the stage of being versioned on GitHub.

Some general advice:

1. **Encapsulate everything within one directory, which is named after the project.** Have a single directory for a project, containing all of the data, code, and results for that project. This makes it easier to find things, or to zip it all up and hand it off to someone else.
2. **Separate the data from the code.** I prefer to put code and data in separate subdirectories. Iâ€™ll often have a `data/` subdirectory and a `scripts/` (or `src`) subdirectory.
3. **Use relative paths (never absolute paths).** If you encapsulate all data and code within a single project directory, then you can refer to data files with relative paths (e.g., `../data/some_file.csv`). If you were to use an absolute path (like `~/Projects/SomeProject/data/some_file.csv` or `C:\Users\SomeOne\Projects\SomeProject\data\some_file.csv)` then anyone who wanted to reproduce your results but had the project placed in some other location would have to go in and edit all of those directory/file names.
4. **Write dates as YYYY-MM-DD**. This sorts properly and also avoids ambiguities.
5. **Include readme files**. This bit of documentation greatly helps in describing what a folder contains.
6. **Continually up-to-date directory.** I aim for a clean and up-to-date directory that is continually modified rather than a chronological electronic lab notebook. Though a separate electronic lab notebook can be hugely helpful.

### Miscellaneous advice

[More excellent advice from Karl Broman](https://kbroman.org/dataorg/)

## Tidy data

Tidy data is term from Hadley Wickham and refers to:

>A standard method of displaying a multivariate set of data is in the form of a data matrix in which rows correspond to sample individuals and columns to variables, so that the entry in the ith row and jth column gives the value of the jth variate as measured or observed on the ith individual.

Data in this form is much easier to deal with programmatically. This is also known as a _data frame_. This [tutorial presents a nice overview](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).

Observations as rows and variables as columns is an excellent standard to adhere to.

1. Each variable forms a column
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

See for example, single cell RNA sequencing data, with cells as rows and genes as columns. This is also the way that relational databases (MySQL, Postgres, etc...) are constructed.

### Exercise on tidy data

1. Demonstrate conversion of simple example dataset. Work from [Table 2 in Bedford et al. 2014](https://bedford.io/papers/bedford-flux/), available as an [Excel table in the course repo](tables/influenza-evolutionary-parameters.xlsx).

2. Pair up to work from an HI table and convert to tidy data. Data available as an [Excel table in the coarse repo](tables/influenza-titer-data.xlsx).

## File formats

Saving data as plain text files is necessarily to process this data with either R or Python. You can export from Excel to `.tsv` (tab-delimited, my preferred format) or `.csv` (comma-delimited). Beware of line endings.
