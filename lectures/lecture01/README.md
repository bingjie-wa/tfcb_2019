## Reminders

- Complete the [pre-class survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduC2isWymIuXkZ5086TnpVnqfQ1VXVmFSuFvbqgCGePa2ibA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
- Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/tree/master/software) to complete software installation and testing.
- If you are not already affiliated with Fred Hutch, you need to complete a non-employee action form to obtain a HutchNetID (this is required to access computational resources). Please make sure Kate has your completed form by the start of the second class meeting.
